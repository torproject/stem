Getting started with any new library can be rather daunting, so let's get our
feet wet by jumping straight in with some tutorials...

       Basics for talking with Tor. This will step you through configuring Tor
       and writing your first script to talk with it.

       Rather than talking to Tor, we'll now talk **through** it. In this
       tutorial we'll programmatically start Tor then use it to read a site
       through mother Russia!

       As Tor runs it generates a variety of **events** that controllers can
       subscribe to be notified of. In this tutorial we'll do just that,
       writing a curses application that graphs the bandwidth usage of Tor.

       Getting and acting upon information about relays in the Tor network.
       Relay information is provided through documents called **descriptors**.
       This walks you through both where to get them and a small script to tell
       you the fastest Tor exits.

       Sometimes it's easiest to learn a library by seeing how it's used in the
       wild. This is a directory of scripts and applications that use stem.
